Summary: Follow-up ticket focused on making `loupedeck verbs ...` the primary execution namespace for annotated jsverbs scene commands discovered from configured repositories, while keeping execution on the hardware-owned runtime path and tightening the related JS docs/examples.

# Embed jsverbs as first-class loupedeck CLI commands and tighten JS scene docs

## Overview

This ticket picks up the next UX step after `LOUPE-JSVERBS`.

The previous ticket made annotated scripts work correctly on the shared `go-go-goja` runtime and shipped a transitional split between `run --verb`, `verbs list/help`, and `doc`.

This follow-up replaces that transitional shape with a clean cutover. The intended end state is that annotated scene commands execute directly under `loupedeck verbs ...`, for example `loupedeck verbs documented configure`, while `run` returns to being the plain-file runner and the old wrapper/inspection surfaces are removed.

The same ticket also includes the postponed docs/example tightening work related to the JS scene flow.

## Status

Current status: **implemented; pending optional hardware + reMarkable follow-up**

## Scope

### In scope

- first-class CLI embedding of annotated scene verbs under `loupedeck verbs ...`
- reuse of `CommandDescriptionForVerb(...)` + `InvokeInRuntime(...)` through the native loupedeck hardware execution path
- repository discovery so all annotated scripts can be exposed
- docs/example tightening related to the new flow

### Deferred

- generic JS error-reporting polish
- doc server / `--serve`
- multi-script registry work
- richer interactive verb value UX
